# Far Away

Far Away is a web application that will help you manage your packing list when going on a picnic, your favorite vacation, or even a business trip.

# Getting Started

To get started, first download the files and run the "npm i" command in the terminal to install all the dependencies.

# Usage

Users can enter the items they want to pack and the respective quantities of the same using the form. Just select the quantity, enter the name 
of the item and click the "Enter" key on your keyboard or the "Add" button alongside the form. Doing so will result in the item you just added 
showing up in the "List Area" area right below the form. Here you can click on the checkbox associated with each item to mark it as completed or 
click on the "X" button associated with each item to remove it.

I have also implemented a "sort" option to improve user experience. Using the "sort" option, you can "sort" the items in the list by order of input, 
by what is packed and what is not packed and last but not least, by alphabetical order. Alongside the "sort" option, I have also provided a "clear 
list" button to instantly clear the list, instead of having to delete all the items one by one by clicking on the "X" button next to each list item.
